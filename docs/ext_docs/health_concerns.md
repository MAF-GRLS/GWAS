## Health Concerns in Golden Retrievers: A Literature Review

Golden Retrievers are one of the most popular breeds in the world, known for their friendly demeanor and beautiful golden coats. However, as with any breed, they are prone to specific health problems. This review aims to summarize some of the most prevalent health concerns in Golden Retrievers.

A) Breed-specific

1. **Hip Dysplasia**:
   A common concern in many larger dog breeds, hip dysplasia is an abnormal formation of the hip socket. Over time, this can lead to arthritis and pain.

Evaluation of risk factors for degenerative joint disease associated with hip dysplasia in German Shepherd Dogs, Golden Retrievers, and Rottweilers. Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, 219(12), 1719-1724.

2. **Elbow Dysplasia**:
   This is a condition affecting the elbow joint and can lead to pain and lameness in affected dogs.

3. **Cancer**:
   Unfortunately, Golden Retrievers have a higher incidence of cancer compared to many other breeds. Common cancers include hemangiosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and lymphoma.

4. **Eye Disorders**:
   Cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy, and retinal dysplasia are some of the eye-related issues that Golden Retrievers may face.

5. **Cardiac Issues**:
   Golden Retrievers can suffer from subvalvular aortic stenosis, a congenital heart condition.

6. **Allergies**:
   Skin allergies resulting from environmental triggers or food allergies can be a common issue.

7. **Ear Infections**:
   Their floppy ears make Golden Retrievers more prone to ear infections.

8. **Thyroid Disorders**:
   Hypothyroidism is a concern in Golden Retrievers, leading to various symptoms like lethargy, weight gain, and skin problems.

9. **Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD)**: This is a condition wherein the cartilage in a joint grows improperly and can lead to painful bone spurs. It typically affects the shoulders.

   *Reference*: Olsson, S. E. (1982). Osteochondrosis in domestic animals. Acta Radiologica. Supplementum, 358, 299-306.

10. **Von Willebrand's Disease**: This is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. It can cause excessive bleeding in dogs after surgery or injury.

11. **Epilepsy**: Some Golden Retrievers can suffer from epilepsy, a neurological disorder that can cause seizures.

   *Reference*: Berendt, M., Farquhar, R. G., Mandigers, P. J. J., Pakozdy, A., Bhatti, S. F. M., De Risio, L., ... & Haagsman, A. N. (2015). International veterinary epilepsy task force consensus report on epilepsy definition, classification, and terminology in companion animals. BMC veterinary research, 11(1), 1-9.

12. **Pyometra**: Being a common issue in many breeds, pyometra is an infection in the uterus that can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

   *Reference*: Hagman, R. (2017). Pyometra in small animals. Veterinary Clinics: Small Animal Practice, 47(4), 783-805.

13. **Gastric Dilation-Volvulus (GDV or bloat)**: This is a serious condition where the stomach fills with gas and then twists. It can be fatal if not treated immediately.

   *Reference*: Glickman, L. T., Glickman, N. W., Schellenberg, D. B., Raghavan, M., & Lee, T. L. (2000). Incidence of and breed-related risk factors for gastric dilatation-volvulus in dogs. Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, 216(1), 40-45.

14. **Skin Disorders**: Apart from allergies, Golden Retrievers can also be prone to various skin disorders, including hot spots or acute moist dermatitis.

B) Not breed-specific

1. **Heartworms**: Golden Retrievers, like all dogs, are susceptible to heartworm disease. Heartworm disease is a serious disease that results in severe lung disease, heart failure, other organ damage, and death in pets, mainly dogs, cats, and ferrets. It is caused by a parasitic worm called Dirofilaria immitis. The worms are spread through the bite of a mosquito

2. **Dental Diseases**: Like other dogs, Golden Retrievers can suffer from periodontal disease, gingivitis, and other dental problems.
  
   *Reference*: Harvey, C. E. (1998). Management of periodontal disease: understanding the options. Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice, 28(5), 1129-1147.

3. **Infectious Diseases**: These dogs can be affected by various infectious diseases, such as parvovirus, distemper, and leptospirosis.

5. **Cushings Disease (Hyperadrenocorticism)**: This endocrine disorder, where the adrenal glands produce too much cortisol, can affect Golden Retrievers among other breeds.

   *Reference*: Galac, S., Kars, V. J., Voorhout, G., Mol, J. A., & Kooistra, H. S. (2005). ACTH-independent hyperadrenocorticism due to food-dependent hypercortisolism in a dog: a case report. Veterinary Journal, 169(3), 419-422.

6. **Diabetes Mellitus**: Not exclusive to Golden Retrievers but still a concern for many dog breeds.

   *Reference*: Catchpole, B., Ristic, J. M., Fleeman, L. M., & Davison, L. J. (2005). Canine diabetes mellitus: can old dogs teach us new tricks?. Diabetologia, 48(10), 1948-1956.
