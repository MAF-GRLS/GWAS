Histiocytic sarcoma is an aggressive hematopoietic malignancy of mature tissue histiocytes. Flat-coated retrievers (FCRs) have unusually high frequency (lethal in 20%). GWASs identifying two significant risk loci on CFA 5 (Pwald = 4.83x10-9) and 19 (Pwald = 2.25x10-7). A multi-omics approach generating whole genome, transcriptome, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing highlighted the PI3K pathway gene PIK3R6 on CFA5, and proximal candidate regulatory variants that are strongly associated with histiocytic sarcoma and predicted to impact transcription factor binding. **The CFA5 association colocalizes with susceptibility loci for two hematopoietic malignancies, hemangiosarcoma and B-cell lymphoma, in the closely related golden retriever breed, revealing the risk contribution this single locus makes to multiple hematological cancers.** By comparison, the CFA19 locus is unique to the FCR and harbors risk alleles associated with upregulation of TNFAIP6, which itself affects cell migration and metastasis. Together, these loci explain ~35% of disease risk. <br> <br>

Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a rare but aggressive cancer in both humans and dogs with specific breed predispositions. This study combined several GWASs in a multi-breed (Bernese mountain dogs, Rottweilers, flat-coated retrievers, and golden retrievers) and multi-cancer (HS, lymphoma, and mast cell tumor). Results confirmed the previously identified HS risk CDKN2A locus on CFA 11.  Also identified new loci on canine chromosomes 2, 5, 14, and 20. Capture and targeted sequencing of specific loci suggested the existence of regulatory variants in non-coding regions and methylation mechanisms linked to risk haplotypes, which lead to strong cancer predisposition in specific dog breeds. We also showed that these canine cancer predisposing loci appeared to be due to the additive effect of several risk haplotypes involved in other hematopoietic cancers such as lymphoma or mast cell tumors as well. <br> <br>

T zone lymphoma (TZL) represents about 12% of all canine lymphomas. Golden Retrievers appear predisposed, representing over 40% of TZL cases. Asymptomatic aged Golden Retrievers frequently have populations of T zone-like cells (phenotypically identical to TZL) of undetermined significance (TZUS), potentially representing a pre-clinical state. Dogs were categorized as TZL (n = 95), TZUS (n = 142), or control (n = 101) using flow cytometry and genotyped using the Illumina CanineHD BeadChip. Using a mixed linear model adjusting for population stratification, we found association with genome-wide significance in regions on chromosomes 8 and 14. The chromosome 14 peak included four SNPs (Odds Ratio = 1.18-1.19, p = .3 × 10- 5-5.1 × 10- 5) near three hyaluronidase genes (SPAM1, HYAL4, and HYALP1). Targeted resequencing identified missense mutations in all three genes; the variant in SPAM1 was predicted to be damaging. **These mutations were also associated with risk for mast cell tumors among Golden Retrievers in an unrelated study**. The chromosome 8 peak contained 7 SNPs (Odds Ratio = 1.24-1.42, p = 2.7 × 10- 7-7.5 × 10- 5) near genes involved in thyroid hormone regulation (DIO2 and TSHR). A prior study from our laboratory found hypothyroidism is inversely associated with TZL risk. No coding mutations were found with targeted resequencing but identified variants may play a regulatory role for all or some of the genes. <br> <br>

Mast cell tumours (MCT) are the most common type of skin cancer in dogs with known breed-predisposition. In in Labrador Retrievers, GWAS combined with targeted next generation sequencing, and TaqMan genotyping identified a synonymous variant in the DSCAM gene on CAF 31. Furthermore, we showed that the variant is also associated with MCT in Golden Retrievers. The variant is common in both Labradors and Golden Retrievers and consequently is likely to be a significant genetic contributor to the increased susceptibility of both breeds to develop mast cell tumours. <br> <br>

... somatic mutations in the oncogene C-KIT have been detected in a proportion of Canine MCT. GWAS in golden retrievers from two continents identified separate regions in the two populations. Sequence capture of associated regions and subsequent fine mapping in a larger cohort of dogs identified a SNP associated with development of MCT in the GNAI2 gene (p = 2.2x10-16), introducing an alternative splice form of this gene resulting in a truncated protein. In addition, disease associated haplotypes harbouring the hyaluronidase genes HYAL1, HYAL2 and HYAL3 on cfa20 and HYAL4, SPAM1 and HYALP1 on cfa14 were identified as separate risk factors in European and US golden retrievers, respectively, suggesting that turnover of hyaluronan plays an important role in the development of CMCT.

Pyometra is inflammation and bacterial infection of the uterus. There is clear breed predisposition (risk ratio: 3.3 in GR). GWAS with mixed model. GWAS comparing 98 cases, and 96 controls identified an associated locus on chromosome 22 (p = 1.2 × 10-6). This locus contained five significantly associated SNPs positioned within introns of the ATP-binding cassette transporter 4 (ABCC4) gene. NGS and genotyping of cases and controls subsequently identified four missense SNPs within the ABCC4 gene. One missense SNP at chr22:45,893,198 (p.Met787Val) showed complete LD with the associated GWAS SNPs suggesting a potential role in disease development. Another locus on chromosome 18 overlapping the TESMIN gene, is also potentially implicated in the development of the disease. <br> <br>

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) causes progressive muscle degeneration, cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure in approximately 1/5,000 boys. Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) resembles DMD both clinically and pathologically. The disease exhibits remarkable phenotypic variation among affected dogs, suggesting the influence of modifiers. A linear mixed-model (LMM) analysis using 16 variably-affected dogs from our GRMD colony (8 dystrophic vs 8 non-dystrophic).  <br> <br>
