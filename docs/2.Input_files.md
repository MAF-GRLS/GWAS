## 2.1. Genotyping data
1.  In this tutorial, we have the [GRLS genotyping data](https://github.com/MAF-GRLS/grGWAS/blob/dev/GRLS_Axiom.json) of each array in a binary PLINK file format. You may use the [PLINK documentation](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/input#bed) to read more about this file format. 
    - The files of array A have the prefix "output/setA/export_plink/AxiomGT1.bin"
    - The files of array B have the prefix "output/setB/export_plink/AxiomGT1.bin".
    
    The genotyping files are accompanied by `genotyping_analysis_notes.docx` which has detailed information on the bioinformatic pipeline used for genotyping and all notes that should be considered before any further analysis. You can download this file separately from [here](https://github.com/MAF-GRLS/grGWAS/raw/main/Genotyping_Analysis_Notes.docx)

    **_Note:_** These PLINK files have the gender as predicted by the Axiom genotyping analysis tools which was not always consistant with the gender in the dog records. Check the [genotyping analysis notes](https://github.com/MAF-GRLS/grGWAS/raw/main/Genotyping_Analysis_Notes.docx) for details

2.  A text file that maps between sample IDs in the genotyping files, biological sample IDs, and the public IDs used in phenotype data files. Moreover, the file has gender information of the dogs as reported by their owners: `map_id_sex.tab`
   
## 2.2. Phenotype data
In this tutorial, all phenotypes tables are located in a folder named `phenotypes`. We are using the [Conditions - Neoplasia](https://datacommons.morrisanimalfoundation.org/artisanal_dataset/71) dataset as an example.
