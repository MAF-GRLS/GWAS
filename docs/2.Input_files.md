## 2. Input files
## 2.1. Genotyping data
1.  Affymetrix (thermofisher) Axiom Canine HD Array sets A and B were used to genotype the GRLS dogs. In this tutorial, we have the GRLS genotyping data of each array in a binary PLINK file format. You may use the [PLINK documentation](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/input#bed) to read more about this file format. The [genotyping analysis notes]() has detailed information on the bioinformatic pipeline used for genotyping and all notes that should be considered before any further analysis.
    - The files of array A have the prefix "output/setA/export_plink/AxiomGT1.bin"
    - The files of array B have the prefix "output/setB/export_plink/AxiomGT1.bin".

    **_Note:_** These PLINK files have the gender as predicted by the Axiom genotyping analysis tools. Check the [genotyping analysis notes]() for details

2.  A text file that maps between sample IDs in the genotyping files, biological sample IDs, and the public IDs used in phenotype data files. Moreover, the file has gender information of the dogs as reported by their owners: `map_id_sex.tab`
   
## 2.2. Phenotype data
Morris Animal Foundation [Data Commons](https://datacommons.morrisanimalfoundation.org/) provides open access to most of the data collected by the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study. An overview description of the study data can be found [here](https://datacommons.morrisanimalfoundation.org/node/221). To download data tables, you need to [register](https://datacommons.morrisanimalfoundation.org/user/login?destination=/node/1) at the Data Commons.

In this tutorial, we are using the [Conditions - Neoplasia](https://datacommons.morrisanimalfoundation.org/artisanal_dataset/71) dataset as an example.
