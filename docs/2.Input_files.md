**_Important Note:_** This page will be updated to include the download commands once the data is publicly available


## 2.1. Genotyping data
1.  The [GRLS genotyping data](https://github.com/MAF-GRLS/grGWAS/blob/dev/GRLS_Axiom.json) is available in a binary PLINK file format for each of two Axiom array sets A and B. You may use the [PLINK documentation](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/input#bed) to read more about this file format. In this tutorial, the data was downloaded to the working directory where:
    - The files of array A have the prefix `output/setA/export_plink/AxiomGT1.bin`
    - The files of array B have the prefix `output/setB/export_plink/AxiomGT1.bin`
    

    ---
    **_Note:_** These PLINK files have the gender as predicted by the Axiom genotyping analysis tools which was not always consistant with the gender in the dog records. Check the [genotyping analysis notes](https://github.com/MAF-GRLS/grGWAS/raw/main/Genotyping_Analysis_Notes.docx) for details

2.  A text file that maps between sample IDs in the genotyping files, biological sample IDs, and the public IDs used in phenotype data files. Moreover, the file has gender information of the dogs as reported by their owners: `map_id_sex.tab`

## 2.2. Phenotype data
In this tutorial, we are using the [Conditions - Skin](https://datacommons.morrisanimalfoundation.org/artisanal_dataset/91) dataset as an example. The phenotype table was downloaded locally as `phenotypes/conditions_skin.csv`.
