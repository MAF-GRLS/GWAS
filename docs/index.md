# GRLS GWAS Tutorial

Golden Retrievers are one of the most popular breeds in the world, known for their friendly demeanor and beautiful golden coats. However, as with any breed, they are prone to specific [health problems](./ext_docs/health_concerns.md). Several [GWAS studies](./ext_docs/gwas_studies.md) were already done to uncover the underlying genetics of many disorders. Many of these studies need to be confirmed and many other phenotypes still need to be studied  

The [Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS)](https://www.morrisanimalfoundation.org/golden-retriever-lifetime-study) has a vast amount of phenotypic data collected from veterinarian records, and dog owners’ questioners over years for 3,000+ dogs. In addition, the study has genotyped ~ 1.1 Million genetic markers using Axiom™ Canine Genotyping Array Sets A and B. This reposatory should provide [tutorials](./1.install.md) for handling of the GRLS phenotypic and genotypic data to produce successful GWAS studies. Also, we are building a growing list of [resources](./ext_docs/health_concerns.md) to support these studies. 

## How to acess the GRLS data?

## 2.1. Genotyping data
Affymetrix (thermofisher) Axiom Canine HD Array sets A and B were used to genotype the GRLS dogs. The data is avalible in PLINK and VCF formats. Instructions about geting access to the data will be announced soon.
   
## 2.2. Phenotype data
Morris Animal Foundation [Data Commons](https://datacommons.morrisanimalfoundation.org/) provides open access to most of the data collected by the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study. An overview description of the study data can be found [here](https://datacommons.morrisanimalfoundation.org/node/221). To download data tables, you need to [register](https://datacommons.morrisanimalfoundation.org/user/login?destination=/node/1) at the Data Commons.
