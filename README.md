# GWAS of GRLS data

Golden Retrievers are one of the most popular breeds in the world, known for their friendly demeanor and beautiful golden coats. However, as with any breed, they are prone to specific [health problems](https://morrisanimalfoundation.github.io/grGWAS/ext_docs/health_concerns/). Several [GWAS studies](https://morrisanimalfoundation.github.io/grGWAS/ext_docs/gwas_studies/) have already been done to uncover many disorders' underlying genetics. Many of these studies need to be confirmed, and many other phenotypes still need to be studied.  

The Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS) has a vast amount of phenotypic data collected from veterinarian records and dog owners’ questionnaires over the years for 3,000+ dogs. In addition, the study has genotyped ~ 1.1 Million genetic markers using Axiom™ Canine Genotyping Array Sets A and B. This repository should provide tutorials for handling the GRLS phenotypic and genotypic data to produce successful GWAS studies. Also, we are building a growing list of resources to support these studies.

## How to access the GRLS data?

## 2.1. Genotyping data
The GRLS genotyping dataset is publicly available in a PLINK file format. More information about this dataset and how to access it can be found [here](https://github.com/morrisanimalfoundation/grGWAS/blob/main/GRLS_Axiom.json).

## 2.2. Phenotype data
Morris Animal Foundation [Data Commons](https://datacommons.morrisanimalfoundation.org/) provides open access to most of the data collected by the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study. An overview description of the study data can be found [here](https://datacommons.morrisanimalfoundation.org/node/221). To download data tables, you must [register](https://datacommons.morrisanimalfoundation.org/user/login?destination=/node/1) at the Data Commons.
